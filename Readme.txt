Project Execution:
-------------------

1) Download Liar-Plus dataset from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ABe8l6OVMmj1M3DXFYJ2kyQ19B2GdyNR?usp=sharing

2) Make sure that bertclassifier.pynb file and dataset folder are together.

3) Run the bertclassifier.pynb python notebook file in jupyter notebook or google colab.

4) Since all the required packages are directly written in bertclassifier.pynb file, running that specific cell makes you directly download the required packages.

5) Since we are using BERT model, the execution time is very high i.e 305 minutes.
